<h1>User Task API</h1>

This project is an API developed using Laravel 10, designed to efficiently store and manage users and their associated tasks. The API was created as part of the Udemy course "Fullstack Laravel 10 + Vue.js 3 (2023) - Build APIs and SPAs." Through this course, I gained practical experience in several key areas:

    User Authentication: Implemented using Laravel Sanctum to ensure secure access and management of user data.
    CRUD Operations: Developed comprehensive Create, Read, Update, and Delete functionalities for managing users and tasks within the database.
    Route Testing: Utilized Postman to thoroughly test and verify API routes, ensuring reliable and consistent API behavior.

This project serves as a practical example of building robust APIs with Laravel, incorporating modern development practices and tools.
